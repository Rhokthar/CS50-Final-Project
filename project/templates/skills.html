                <!-- DESCRIPTION START -->
                <p>In my various studies, I've learnt many programming languages, both for the front and the back end, and I can tell you that I will <b>never</b> stop learning new and fresh skills.</p>
                <p>My personal opinion is that no one in the world, even if he could dedicate his entire life to it, would be able to know <i>everything</i> of a particular argument or skill. Maybe is an unpopular one, but I strongly believe it.</p>
                <p>Particularly in Computer Science, the amount of stuff that we all can learn and improve at, is SO big that we can never stop learning.</p>
                <p>That's why, telling that "I know this thing" in Computer Science is not accurate, at least for me. You can say "I know <i>this part</i> of that thing", but knowing one thing entirely, it's never gonna happen. And by entirely I mean <i>really</i> entirely: every application of every library, every function, every class... No way.
                <p>So, that said, when I list my skills, I mean that I have, more or less, a strong base of how that language works, how to implement logic and data structures and how to handle problems with it, and that's also why every language you'll see on the graphic won't cap the progress bar: there's always something new to learn or something to get better at, in every given language.</p>
                <p>Here are my programming skills and also something more. Hope that this can help you understand what I'm capable of ðŸ˜‰</p>
