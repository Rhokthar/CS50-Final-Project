                <p>This was a project done for the CS50's Harvard Course. It's a simple web application who tracks a portfolio of the possessed market stocks. It uses IEX API for getting real time value of every given stock. It also has a back-end done in Python with the implementation of Flask's framework.</p>

                <p>In this simple console program made in Python, I was asked to format an arithmetic calculator, bot for sum and substraction, to display the arithmetic problem and solution vertically. I had to follow some instructions and some limitation for making it as the client asked, such as 9999 as max number, only sum and substraction etc.</p>
